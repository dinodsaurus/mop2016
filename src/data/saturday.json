Mastering these elements of drawing by sight helps with good eye-to-hand coordination and other skills crucial to actualizing our thoughts and ideas as designers.",

Obviously, less products are build with women in mind because there is less women involved in building them, but it is a huge misconception that women are not interested in technology, they’re just overlooked as users!

By distorting objects and blurring the limits of visual perception the audience is immersed in projections of abstract forms and spaces even if for a short while. At the same time sound effects enhance the experience. The audience is not just a passive observer of the interaction between the virtual and physical but is also an active user and controller of the content by using a sensor that recognises hand gestures and movement in that way transforming the sound and the projection.",
