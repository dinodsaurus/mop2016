They approach every project with the same basic mission – to find a quality, creative solution which will give it communication strength, longevity, and set it apart from the competition. That approach is applied in every aspect of their work: visual identities, signage, exhibition design, stand design, publication design, ads and promo materials, souvenir design… They carry out and control projects from start to finish, with the help of regular associates; architects, product designers, art directors, animators, programmers and print shops. The studio has received numerous international and national awards, and their works have been exhibited at most relevant exhibitions in the region, as well as in many professional publications.",

The identity is comprised of 19 individual visual identities for all Nature Parks and National Parks and the cover identity of ‘Parks of Croatia’. In their estimate, that is the most extensive design work done for state institutions in the last 10 years. The lecture about this project will cover all the phases of the project: design proposals, execution, implementation and assessment of the current condition a year or two after the implementation. ",
